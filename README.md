# 711RayTracer
Raytracer for CSCI 711.

# Setup
This was originally written for CSCI 711 @ RIT (Global Illumination). As such, several things need to be noted:
- It was designed in stages, each of which had deliverables.
- More to come (usage, etc.)
- The end goal is to allow integration with more "practical" libraries (Allegro/SDL)
